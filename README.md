Email spam detection is the process of identifying and filtering out unsolicited and often malicious emailsâ€”commonly referred to as spam. 
This is crucial for maintaining the effectiveness and security of email communication. 
Spam emails can range from simple marketing messages to sophisticated phishing attempts and malware distributions.
Effective email spam detection combines multiple techniques, from rule-based systems and heuristic methods to advanced machine learning models. 
As spamming tactics evolve, spam detection systems must continuously adapt to safeguard users from unwanted and potentially harmful emails.
